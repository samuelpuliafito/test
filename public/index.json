[{"content":"This website contains my writing on books, film, and music subjects.\nHow to read New Grub Street I strongly recommend that you print out the posts that you find interesting. I advise this because I want you to read what I have written. Printing articles on real paper is the preferred way to read this website. People do not read content on the web deeply.1\nAlternatively, you can save and/or send posts to an e-reader, such as a Kobo or a Kindle. These devices are distraction-limited, present text in a typographically superior (and customizable) way, and don\u0026rsquo;t require constant backlighting.\nYou can also save posts to Instapaper or Pocket. These services offer elegant typography and track your reading across devices. However, they typically require self-luminous displays (e.g., a phone or monitor), which are inferior for reading. (Kobo e-readers offer built-in Pocket support and Instapaper can automatically forward articles to a Kindle. Pocket is extensible to Kindle using third-party services.)\nLastly, you can read articles on this domain in your browser. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend this method as it encourages sloppy reading habits, such as scanning the text, clicking on hyperlinks, and revisiting open tabs.\nWhy does this exist? I want to write more.\nGeneral notes New Grub Street is built on Hugo and uses a modified PaperMod theme.\nUpdated January 27, 2021\n  The research on this point is significant and not new.
