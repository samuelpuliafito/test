### How to read New Grub Street

I strongly recommend that you *print out the posts* that you find interesting. I advise this because I want you to read what I have written. **Printing articles on real paper is the preferred way to read this website.** People do not read content on the web deeply.[^1]

Alternatively, you can save and/or send posts to an e-reader, such as a Kobo or a Kindle. These devices are distraction-limited, present text in a typographically superior (and customizable) way, and don't require constant backlighting.

You can also save posts to [Instapaper][instapaper] or [Pocket][pocket]. These services offer elegant typography and track your reading across devices. However, they typically require self-luminous displays (e.g., a phone or monitor), which are inferior for reading. (Kobo e-readers offer built-in Pocket support and Instapaper can automatically forward articles to a Kindle. Pocket is extensible to Kindle using third-party services.)

Lastly, you can read articles on this domain in your browser. I don't recommend this method as it encourages sloppy reading habits, such as scanning the text, clicking on hyperlinks, and revisiting open tabs.

### General notes

<!--I do not use a standardized system of citation. It is important to show your work and most stylebooks are arcane, encourage Instead, I focus on clarity, avoid abbreviations, and try to provide links to the material directly.-->

New Grub Street is built on [Hugo][hugo link] and uses a modified [PaperMod][papermod link] theme.
